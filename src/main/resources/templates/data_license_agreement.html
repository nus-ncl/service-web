<p class="c5"><span class="c0">(i) You agrees to safeguard any and all sensitive data as required, or may be required, by law by using at least the same degree of care that You uses for its own data of a like nature but no less than a reasonable degree of care, to protect the confidentiality of data and/or the privacy of any identifiable person and to prevent its unauthorized disclosure and use. Data is confidential if it is marked as such, if by its nature or content is reasonably distinguishable as confidential, or if You have reasonable cause to believe that its disclosure to a third party would cause harm or damage. </span>
</p>
<p class="c5"><span class="c0">Data is not confidential, and therefore not sensitive if: (a) You already knew the data before it was disclosed to You by NCL; (b) You gain subsequent knowledge of the data by either lawfully obtaining it from another source under no obligation of confidentiality, or You develop it independently; (c) the data is or becomes generally available to the public through no wrongful act of You or any other party; (e) it is required to be disclosed under applicable law, regulation or court order provided You notify NCL prior to making such a disclosure so that NCL may take appropriate action. </span>
</p>
<p class="c5"><span class="c0">(ii) You will notify NCL immediately of all relevant details if: (a) confidentiality or privacy is compromised; or (b) You receive any legal, investigatory, or other government demand to reverse engineer, decrypt, de-anonymize or otherwise disclose anonymized or confidential data. </span>
</p>
<p class="c5"><span class="c0">(iii) If requested, You will provide NCL evidence of compliance with this AGREEMENT, such as a written description of Your data protection plan or a written affirmation that You have disposed of any and all copies of the received dataset from all systems reasonably known to you. &nbsp;</span>
