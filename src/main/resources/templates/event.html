                        <p align="justify">NCL organized the NCL User Forum II, in conjunction with the Singapore Cybersecurity Consortium Technology Talk III, on 25th August 2017 at NUS School of Computing. This joint event aims to bring together representatives from Consortium member companies, researchers and students in IHLs, RIs, government agencies as well as NCL users to share and showcase recent cybersecurity research work and projects. Associate Professor Liang Zhenkai, one of the lead-PI&apos;s of NCL, was invited to give a talk titled &quot;WannaCry Ransomware Analysis in NCL&apos;s Environment &amp; Demo&quot;. Prof Liang gave a comprehensive introduction to NCL and, using the WannaCry ransomware as an example, demonstrated how NCL testbed could be used to simplify and facilitate researchers&apos;experimentation effort. Following that, Dr. Zhang Chunwang, Programme Manager of NCL, gave an update on the new capabilities and features available on the NCL testbed, including vulnerability environment platform, virtual enterprise networking environment and SDN provisioning tool. This joint event was well received from local cybersecurity R&amp;D community with around 80 registered participants. </p>
